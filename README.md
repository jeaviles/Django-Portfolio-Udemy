# Django-Portfolio-Udemy
Portfolio website clone. I made this with Django 2.0.2 and Python 3.5.2. Additionally, I attached an export file of the virtual environment that I used. 

In order to get the project running you must setup a postgreSQL server using the details in the settings file and you must generate a hash for the secret key.
